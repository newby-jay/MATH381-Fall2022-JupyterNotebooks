Taking the determinant to both sides of the above equation yields $\\det(P) \\det(A) = \\det(L)\\det(U)$. Since $\\det(L) = 1$ we have that $\\det(A) = \\det(U)/\\det(P)$. If we know $\\det(P)$ then our formula is given by $\\det(A) = \\frac{1}{\\det(P)} \\prod_{i=1}^n u_{ii}$. This last follows from the fact that $U$ is upper triangular.\n",

Hence $\\det(P) = \\pm 1$. to determine the sign of the determinant, we define $m$ to be the number of row swaps used in Gauassian elimination with partial pivoting, and we define $\\sigma = (-1)^m$. The matrix $P$ is rarely formed explicitly. Instead a vector of row permutations is stored and one can keep track of the number of row swaps that are used. One can show that $\\det(P) = \\sigma$.
